        Run your Raspberry Pi off-grid with solar power. Here's what you need

        Got enough sun? Here's everything you need to power your outdoor

      <h4>
        Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Contributing Writer on May 24, 2023
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'm working on an exciting Raspberry Pi project that requires the
        single-board computer to operate off-grid for a whole week, while
        efficiently powering the Pi itself, some low-power environmental
        sensors, and a 4G cellular/GPS module. Size and weight constraints are
        not major issues (within reasonable limits), so harnessing solar energy
        seems like the most logical solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I considered connecting a solar panel to a power bank and
        using that to run the Pi. Although this approach would work, it felt a
        bit clunky and lacked the reliability necessary for such a demanding
        project. Moreover, power banks aren't designed to handle solar panel
        charging effectively due to the fluctuating power from the panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure a more professional and reliable solution, I needed something
        equipped with MPPT (maximum power point tracking) functionality. This
        feature enables the charge controller to optimize energy collection and
        storage from variable energy sources, such as a solar panel affected by
        changing weather conditions.
      </p>
      <p>That's when I discovered the WaveShare Solar Power Manager.</p>
      <p>
        While the one I purchased required three 18650 lithium-ion batteries, I
        stumbled upon an alternative version with a built-in 10,000mAh
        lithium-polymer battery pack. This particular device serves as an
        optimized solar-input power bank that's designed to handle solar
        charging.
      </p>
      <p>And for $35, it's an absolute steal.</p>
      <p>
        Determining the required power was an important consideration. A Pi 4
        consumes approximately 0.5A of power under average loads, which can
        increase to 1A under heavy loads. This means that a 10,000mAh battery
        pack can power a Pi 4 for roughly 10 to 20 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        (For those who are curious about the math, here's how I calculated this.
        Power bank capacity is measured in mAh [milliamp hours]. So, 10,000mAh
        is equivalent to 10Ah, meaning the battery pack could sustain a 10A load
        for about 1 hour or a 1A load for approximately 10 hours. However,
        real-world efficiency is typically around 80%, so a 10,000mAh power bank
        would comfortably support a 1A load for at least 8 hours.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But that power consumption is for the Pi 4 alone, and not the sensors
        and 4G module that need to be factored in. With that in mind, I chose to
        go with the much more energy-efficient Pi Zero 2 W.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pi Zero 2 W consumes about 0.1A under average loads and can peak at
        around 0.4A under heavy loads. This means the 10,000mAh lithium-polymer
        battery pack will provide an even better runtime for the Pi Zero 2 W,
        and easily handle the additional load of the environmental sensors and
        the 4G module.
      </p>
      <p>
        And don't forget: When the sun is shining, the battery inside the
        WaveShare Solar Power Manager is continually being topped off.
      </p>
      <p>Now, let's talk about the solar panel.</p>
      <p>
        Because solar panels come in various shapes, sizes, and price ranges,
        this is where things can get exciting. Personally, I wanted a solar
        panel that could continuously recharge the batteries while the Raspberry
        Pi was running and had the added benefit of being waterproof.
      </p>
      <p>
        I happened to have an expensive 5V/10W waterproof Voltaic P110 solar
        panel lying around unused. However, if you're looking for a more
        cost-effective option, consider a 5V/6W solar panel designed for
        powering stick up security cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tested this setup and successfully ran a Pi 4 continuously for
        over a week, solely powered by the late spring sun here in the UK, so, I
        am confident that it will be more than capable of handling a Pi Zero 2 W
        equipped with sensors and the 4G module.
      </p>
      <p>It blows my mind just how well this system works.</p>
