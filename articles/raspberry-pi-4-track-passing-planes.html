        Raspberry Pi 4: How I built a software-defined radio system to track
        passing planes
      </h1>
      <h2>Build your own ADS-B flight data receiver and mapper.</h2>
      <h4>Written by Simon Bisson, Contributor on July 6, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        One of the things about being in lockdown here in London is that I've
        had time to work on various projects that have been sat on the back
        burner. So in the last three months or so, I've set up a much improved
        microphone and camera system for podcasting and streaming, built a new
        time-lapse rig for the sky that passes by, practiced my wildlife
        photography on the local suburban critters, and built and set up a
        software-defined radio system to track passing aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        That last one is perhaps the more interesting for ZDNet's readers, as
        it's how you can start to feed aircraft location data into a growing
        network of tracking stations that uses the GPS locations most aircraft
        transmit to build a global map of air traffic. This approach, ADS-B, is
        intended to make it easier for aircraft to locate each other and for air
        traffic control to keep track of them. The fact that the data is there
        for anyone to capture and use is just a side-effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picking up the ADS-B signals is easy enough: they're broadcast on a
        known frequency, 1090MHz, and have to deliver data in a set format. If
        you've got the right receiver, that binary data can be quickly
        translated into coordinates that can be plotted on a map, using
        callsigns to look up aircraft type and owner. You've probably seen
        services like Flightradar24 and Flightaware in the news, offering ADS-B
        information to anyone with a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those services get their data from a network of volunteers, with their
        own ADS-B receivers. Usually based around open source software, their
        base stations are easy enough to build and deploy, using
        software-defined radios to receive ADS-B signals. Most are based around
        a popular chipset that was originally developed to add USB digital TV
        receivers to PCs, with a set of APIs that made it easy to adapt for
        other uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting up an ADS-B base station is now as easy as getting a Raspberry
        Pi, plugging in a receiver, and downloading and configuring a
        ready-to-run system image. My system is based around a 2GB Raspberry Pi
        4 in a heatsink case, with a Flightaware ADS-B radio stick, a 1090MHz
        desktop antenna, and a copy of Flightaware's Piaware software
        distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on Raspbian, Piaware is a headless Linux distribution with all the
        software you need to work with a radio stick, including the Dump1090
        ADS-B Mode S decoder. Dump1090 comes with a built-in web app that maps
        currently tracked aircraft and can also be used to send data to other
        apps and servers, helping feed data into larger public ADS-B networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get kits that include all the parts you need to set up and run
        an ADS-B receiver from hobbyist electronics stores, for around £100
        (including the Raspberry Pi). The basic antenna that comes with these
        kits is good for a start, especially if you have a way of getting it
        outside. You're likely to want to invest in a larger antenna for better,
        longer range, reception so make sure your budget is ready for an extra
        £30 to £60, depending on the length of the antenna.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configuring a receiver is easy enough. You'll need your GPS location to
        4 decimal places, as well as the approximate height of your antenna.
        You'll also need to configure network connections, either WiFi or wired
        ethernet. Most of this can be done by editing the configuration files on
        the Piaware microSD card, letting you treat the whole system as an
        appliance. With the configuration data in place, you can boot your
        server and leave it running. I've additionally configured mine to use
        SSH, so I can log into it from my desktop PC to update Raspbian and the
        Piaware stack as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADS-B isn't the only way to track aircraft. Not all aircraft, especially
        the military, transmit their flight data. However most that don't do at
        least have transponders that broadcast an ID and an altitude on known
        frequencies. If you have enough receivers in known positions, and enough
        compute power, you can use basic physics to identify where an aircraft
        is. This approach is known as multilateration, or, as it's more commonly
        known, MLAT.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've got a receiver set up, it's easy enough to join one or more
        networks to share the signals you receive and help build a live map of
        aircraft all around the world, providing both ADS-B data and the raw
        transponder information that can generate MLAT data. In return for your
        data you'll get access to the networks' subscription services which give
        better and more detailed outputs than the free commercial services – and
        of course, without any advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've initially joined two networks, one of the larger public services
        with nearly 20,000 base stations around the world, and one a private one
        with a focus on identifying unusual and military aircraft across the UK,
        and living near the Thames I'm close to a major low-altitude helicopter
        throughway across London and the city's heliport, where most of the
        traffic is only trackable via MLAT, as well as under the westbound route
        into London Heathrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        My antenna is currently taped to the window ledge of the back bedroom,
        with the Raspberry Pi and receiver on the wall next to the window, using
        WiFi to connect to the rest of my network and on out to the wider world
        of ADS-B data. It's seen aircraft as far away as the coast in Norfolk,
        and tracked military aircraft that are using closed airports for
        training, as well as the regular RAF and Army helicopter traffic up and
        down the river, and even the joint flypast by the French and British
        display teams. It's been an interesting project, and one that looks to
        keep paying off in the months and years to come, especially when I get
        that larger antenna fitted.
