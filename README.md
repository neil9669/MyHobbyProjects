# My Projects Website

Primarily this site is developed with the intention of documenting project that I'm interested in and have completed.  It provides an account of what I did to complete the projects and to document any issues experinced along the way.  So often, I complete a project but then later forget how I achieved the result so do it again.  Inevitably, each project has it's own unique obstacles to overcome and almost always requires some tweeking to make it work.

On a broader level I'm hoping that it will provide a useful resourse to others who are interested in completing the similar projects of their own.

Initially, my first artcle was to be a tutorial on setting up a security camera using Docker on a headless Debian 11 server.  However, I decided that a far more relevant, timely and useful tutorial would be create VSCode local development environment that specifically used the Code Instute recommended template.  This would answer the question that many students posted in the CI Slack channel: "How do I setup a local VSCode dev environment?"
